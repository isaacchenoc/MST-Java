# MST-Java
Minimum spanning tree Java implementation using Kruskal algorithm and Prim algorithm. The program also tests the performance of both algorithms on Complete graphs and random connected graphs.  

Note that this was one solution for an assignment of a ANU course COMP3600 in 2018, so any forms of copying for assignment submission are not allowed.
